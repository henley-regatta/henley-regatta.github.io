//Setup to load the (style) standard definitions:
@import "minima";

// And here's where I'd override stuff if I wanted to. For instance:

//Put a box around the TOC (if generated) and include a header:
#markdown-toc::before {
  content: "Contents";
  font-weight: bold;
}

#markdown-toc {
  width: 75%;
  background: GhostWhite;
  border: 1px dotted darkgrey;
  padding-left: 28px;
  display: inline-block;
}
