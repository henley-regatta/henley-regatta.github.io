# But I thought you said it took up too much time and was too frustrating?

I did [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) and found it...
well, equal parts enjoyable and frustrating at the same time. Didn't complete
it in the alloted time but wasn't too far off (a couple of days) and got my 50
stars. All my efforts are preseved in [github](https://github.com/henley-regatta/adventofcode2020)

Inevitably, the lure of [Avent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) has
proven more than my self-control to resist. As I write this I've done Day 1,
slower than 25000 other people, but I've now done day 1 in 4 languages (Python,
Javascript, Go and Rust). I expect as time goes by that'll drop back to Python
on it's own again.

As with last year, I'm doing this for fun not bragging rights. I've recorded
everything on [github](https://github.com/henley-regatta/adventofcode2021) as
before - isn't pretty, it's not idiomatic, but it does get the answer.
