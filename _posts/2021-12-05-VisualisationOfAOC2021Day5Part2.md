# Writing Graphics To Visualise Answers

I see visualising your answers is the Hot New Thing on [r/adventofcode] and 
today's problem - Work out the intersections of a series of geothermal vents -
lent itself perfectly to this. Not least of all because the easiest way to 
actually come up with the answer you need was to, er, plot lines on a grid.

So here's my visualisation of the solution for my input data:

![Visualisation of Day5 Part2 Solution](/assets/aoc2021_day5part2_visualisation.png)
{:style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;"}

The code used to generate it (but not the source data, which is kinda-sorta
private to me) is in my answers github repo as [python/day5part2_extracredit.py](https://github.com/henley-regatta/adventofcode2021/blob/main/python/day5part2_extracredit.py)
