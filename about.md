I was told that all the _Cool Kids_ are republishing or moving their stuff
here using Github and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for maximum developer
cred.

As a dedicated follower of fashion (sheep), here I am too.

Stuff here is either created specifically or moved from [Other Places](
https://henleyregatta.blogspot.com/). It'll lean very heavily to the 
reminders-to-self and here's-how-I-did-this-nerdy-thing rather than the
more generally interesting, I'm afraid.
